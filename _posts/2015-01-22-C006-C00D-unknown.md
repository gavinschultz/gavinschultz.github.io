```
C006: 86 01        LDA #$01
C008: B7 26 FF     STA $26FF   Store 1 in 0x26FF (9983)
C00B: B7 26 FE     STA $26FE   Store 1 in 0x26FE (9982)
```

We don't know what these values will be used for yet, but the two memory locations `$26FE` and `$26FF` are likely to be 1-byte global variables. We can guess this based on two things:

 1. The CoCo memory map tells us that the memory locations don't have any significance for the CoCo; this is part of a block of free memory available to the game.
 2. By searching the program code ahead, we see that these memory locations are referenced frequently from many different code locations.

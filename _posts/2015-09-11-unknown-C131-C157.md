```
C131: 86 03        LDA #$03    A = 3
C133: 97 51        STA $51     Set $2051 = 3
```

$2051 is likely another global variable but we don't know what it does yet. It does not seem to be read, or change, during a game.

```
C135: 8E 1C F8     LDX #$1CF8  X = $1CF8 (insert_address)
C138: 10 8E 20 4F  LDY #$204F  Y = $204F
C13C: BD D8 29     JSR $D829   Jump to $D829
```

```
D829: 34 30        PSHS ,Y,X   Push X & Y to stack, (insert_address, tempY1)
D82B: 86 02        LDA #$02    A = 2
D82D: 34 02        PSHS ,A     Push A to stack (loop_count_outer)
```

We push some values to the stack, creating variables in the process. We don't need to immediately worry about these, but I've named them according to what I (later) know them to be used for: `insert_address`, `tempY1` and `loop_count_outer`.

```
D82F: A6 A4        LDA ,Y      A = Y->val
D831: 8D 10        BSR $D843   
```

```
D843: 34 30        PSHS ,Y,X   Push X & Y to stack (tempX2, tempY2)
D845: 44           LSRA        A << 1
D846: 44           LSRA        A << 1
D847: 44           LSRA        A << 1
D848: 44           LSRA        A << 1
```

Left-shifting A four times is effectively the same as `A = A * 16`.

We then call - implicitly, because it happens to start at the next instruction - the function `copy_rom_to_ram1(A)` with an offset that will be some multiple of 16.

```
# copy_rom_to_ram1(offset)
D849: C6 10        LDB #$10    B = 16
D84B: 3D           MUL         offset * B
D84C: C3 D8 D7     ADDD #$D8D7 D = D + $D8D7 (ROM address)
D84F: 1F 02        TFR D,Y     Y = D
D851: AE E4        LDX ,S      X = tempX2 (initially insert_address)
```

The offset that we're passed (via the A accumulator) is used to calculate an address deep in the bowels of the cartridge ROM, somewhere on or after `$D8D7`, and assigned to Y.

```
D853: 86 08        LDA #$08    A = 8
D855: 34 02        PSHS ,A     Push A to stack (loop_count_inner)
D857: EC A1        LDD ,Y++    D = Y, Y = Y + 1
D859: ED 84        STD ,X      X->val = D
D85B: 30 88 20     LEAX +$20,X X = X + 32
D85E: 6A E4        DEC ,S      loop_count_inner = loop_count_inner - 1
D860: 26 F5        BNE $D857   Loop until loop_count_inner = 0 (8 loops)
```

With Y a ROM address and X a RAM address, this is clearly another simple copying function, in which we copy 2-byte values directly from the cartridge ROM into RAM. We do this a total of 8 times. In ROM these values are directly adjacent to each other (hence the `Y++`), while in RAM we store these 32-bytes apart (`+$20,X`). A more readable version of the above is:

```
for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++)
{
    memory[X] = memory[Y];
    X += 32;
    Y += 1;
}
```

In any case it's clear that we're populating a collection of 8 (still unknown) data structures that are 32 bytes wide. 

```
D862: 32 61        LEAS +$01,S   Clean-up tempA2
D864: 35 B0        PULS ,X,Y,PC  Clean-up tempX2 & tempY2, return to caller
```

We clean up all the stack variables, simultaneously using the trick of pulling the PC off the stack to simulate an `RTS`, and continue where we left off.

```
D833: 30 02        LEAX +$02,X X = X + 2 (insert_address + 2)
D835: A6 A0        LDA ,Y+     A = Y->val, Y = Y + 1
D837: 8D 2D        BSR $D866   
```

```
D866: 34 30        PSHS ,Y,X   Push X & Y to stack (tempX2, tempY2)
D868: 84 0F        ANDA #$0F   A = A & 00001111
D86A: 20 DD        BRA $D849   Call copy_rom_to_ram1(A)
```

We call the function that will copy from ROM to RAM again, though now A only has the lower-4 bits - which will result in some number less than 16 - and X is offset by +2 bytes. In other words, another copy, just from and to a different address.

Note that we use a `BRA` here instead of a `JSR`, so the address of the current execution point is not placed on the stack. This means that when `copy_rom_to_ram1()` finishes and calls `RTS` (or uses `PULS ,PC` simulates it), we'll be returning to wherever we last used a `BSR` or `JSR`. In this case that will be at `$D839`. This execution flow is not something that can usually be achieved in a higher-level language, though it's really the same as:

```
JSR $B849
RTS
```

This form makes the execution flow explicit, at the cost of one extra byte and one extra instruction.

```
D839: 30 02        LEAX +$02,X  X = X + 2
D83B: 6A E4        DEC ,S       loop_count_outer = loop_count_outer - 1
D83D: 26 F0        BNE $D82F    Loop until loop_count_outer = 0 (2 loops)
```

The entire loop is repeated, but by now 

 - `tempY1` will have be 1 byte higher at `$2050` instead of `$204F`, and
 - `insert_address` will be 4 bytes higher at `$1CFC` instead of `$1CF8`.

```

D841: 35 B0        PULS ,X,Y,PC Clean-up insert_address, tempY1 and return to caller

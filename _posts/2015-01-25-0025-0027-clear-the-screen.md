title:  Clear the screen ($0025â€”0027)
---

```
0025: BD D7 DC     JSR $17DC
```

The subroutine at $17DC looks like this:

```
17DC: 8E 06 00     LDX #$0600
17DF: CC 00 00     LDD #$0000
17E2: ED 81        STD ,X++ 
17E4: 8C 1E 00     CMPX #$1E00
17E7: 26 F9        BNE $17E2
17E9: 39           RTS
```

Huh. So this basically starts at address 0x0600 - which we established was the start of video memory - and zeroes out all the bytes until 0x1E00. Funny, I always thought that zeroing out memory could be done in a single bulk operation somehow, but nope, we have to loop 3,072 times, zeroing out 2 bytes at a time.

It's no coincidence that we're zeroing out exactly 6K of RAM. We previously established that the video RAM would start at 0x0600, and that the COLOR GRAPHICS SIX mode would use 6K of RAM.

In other words, we've turned the whole screen green.

Interestingly, even after doing this there are still some random artifacts on the screen:

Remember that CRT televisions and monitors have an electron gun that fires horizontal beams at the screen, moving back and forth from top-to-bottom? I'm guessing that these artifacts are random bits of data in the video RAM which were there before the memory was cleared, but are still visible simply because those scan-lines have not been reached yet. This is not something I'm used to the in modern era, where the entire screen's data is usually buffered before being displayed.

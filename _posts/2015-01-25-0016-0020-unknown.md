```
C010: CC FF FF     LDD #$FFFF  Set D (A and B) with 1111 1111
C013: FD 26 FA     STD $26FA   Store 1111 1111 to 26FA, 26FB
C01C: FD 26 FC     STD $26FC   Store 1111 1111 to 26FC, 26FD
```

We're setting all the bytes from 0x26FA to 0x26FD to FF (i.e. all 1's). I don't yet know why.

```
C01F: 1A 50        ORCC #$50  Disable hardware interrupts
```

This is identical to $0000, which disabled all hardware interrupts (i.e. disabled all keyboard/joystick inputs). I'm not sure why we need to do that again; perhaps in the intervening code, which fiddled with the SAM, it was possible that these became unset. Running in MESS they do not become unset, so this instruction does nothing.

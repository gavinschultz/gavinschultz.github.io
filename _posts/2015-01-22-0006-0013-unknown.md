## Unknown ($0006---0013)
```
0006: 86 01        LDA #$01
0008: B7 26 FF     STA $26FF   Store 1 in 0x26FF (9983)
000B: B7 26 FE     STA $26FE   Store 1 in 0x26FE (9982)
000E: 86 08        LDA #$08    
0010: B7 27 00     STA $2700   Store 8 in 0x2700 (9984)
```

I don't know what these values will be used for yet, nor can I find any special use for these areas of RAM. When running in MESS, these memory locations appear to already contain the values 1, 1 and 8 respectively.

title:  Initialize galaxy III ($C12Eâ€”C130)
---

```
C12E: BD D3 79   JSR $D379   Jump
```

```
D379: D6 2A      LDB $2A   Set B = player_sector
D37B: D7 29      STB $29   Store player_sector to $2029
```

First we take 

```
D37D: 96 29      LDA $29   Set A = player_sector
D37F: 4C         INCA      A + 1
D380: FD 26 FA   STD $26FA Set $26FA = A + 1, $26FB = A
D383: FD 26 FC   STD $26FC Set $26FC = A + 1, $26FD = A
```

We use the player's galaxy sector to reset the values used by the random_number() function. There's no obvious mathematical outcome of this, but messing with the internals like this is probably a reasonably effective way of re-seeding the random number generator, which helps it to provide more "randomness".

Having said that, since the player position can only be one of 64 possible values, we can likewise only re-seed the generator in 64 different ways.

```
D386: 9E 36        LDX $36    Set X = player_location
D388: 27 06        BEQ $D390  If player_location = 0, go to $D390
D38A: 96 35        LDA $35    Set A = value at $2035
D38C: AB 84        ADDA ,X    A = A + player_location[alien_count]
D38E: A7 84        STA ,X     Store A at X
```

Note that the **player_location** actually serves two purposes:

 1. As an address, it tells us which sector of the galaxy the player is in
 2. The *value* at that address is also the number of aliens in that sector.

That's why we use the term **player_location[alien_count]**; we're using the value at the player_location address, which is the number of aliens in the sector.

We can derive all the other information about the sector by offsetting from the player_location address.

 - player_location + 0 = player_location[alien_count]
 - player_location + 1 = player_location[station_health]
 - player_location + 2 = player_location[???]
 - player_location + 3 = player_location[station_type]

What's at player_location + 4? Since each sector uses only four bytes, this actually puts us in the first byte of the next sector e.g.

 - player_location + 4 = one_sector_beyond_player_location[alien_count]

What we end up doing is effectively to add the number of aliens at the player location to the value at `$2035`. As this is the first time we've used `$2035`, we can't say yet what it might be used for.

```
D390: 96 6F        LDA $6F    Set A = value at $206F
D392: A7 01        STA +$01,X Store A at player_location[station_health]
```


Now we transfer the value at `$206F` to the second byte of the player's sector, which stores the station health of any station in the sector (or `0` if there's no station at all). Again, we don't know what `$206F` is used for yet.

```

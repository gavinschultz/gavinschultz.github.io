## $0000

```
0000: 1A 50        ORCC #$50      Disable hardware interrupts
```

I was (predictably) lost at the very first instruction.

The 6809 has the following condition codes ([source](http://retro.co.za/6809/documents/Byte_6809_Articles.pdf "source")):

![Condition codes register for the 6809](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gavinschultz/gavinschultz.github.io/master/images/6809_condition_code_register.png "6809 Condition Codes Register")

The ORCC command will perform a logical OR on the register with the bitmask:
```
0101 000
```
which corresponds to the INTERRUPT REQUEST MASK and the FAST INTERRUPT REQUEST MASK (the latter being a higher priority interrupt).

Presumably interrupts are disabled so that all keyboard/joystick inputs are disabled during initialization. I am on top of this.

## $0002 â€” 0006
```
0002: 86 20        LDA  #$20      
0004: 1F 8B        TFR  A,DP      
```

title: Initialize video ($0013â€”0015)
---

```
0013: BD D7 B2     JSR $17B2
```

This first part of this subroutine is shown below. Basically what we're doing here is setting up the video display.

```
17B2: 8E FF C6     LDX #$FFC6   Address for SAM VDG display offset
17B5: 86 03        LDA #$03     Set A to 3 (binary 000 0011)
17B7: C6 07        LDB #$07     Set B to 7
17B9: 8D 12        BSR $17CD    Set SAM, 7 bits with mask 000 0011
```

"Hang on a minute," you say. "What's this 'SAM'? What's this 'VDG'? What are we doing here?". Fair questions, which require a diversion into how video works for the CoCo.

The subroutine at $17CD, I'll call `write_to_SAM_register`:

```
17CD: 46           RORA        
17CE: 24 06        BCC $17D6   Branch if carry-bit 0
17D0: 30 01        LEAX +$01,X 
17D2: A7 80        STA ,X+     
17D4: 20 02        BRA $17D8
17D6: A7 81        STA ,X++ 
17D8: 5A           DECB
17D9: 26 F2        BNE $17CD  Next B (i.e. return to top)
17DB: 39           RTS
```

As I discovered later, this piece of code is the idiomatic way to set these bits on the SAM, and is actually listed almost exactly as above on page 16 of the MC6883 technical specs.

I rewrote this function in C, once loosely mimicking the ASM instructions, and then again at a "higher level" just trying to recreate the functionality. Neither is very satisfying, mostly because you're ultimately 

The addresses 0xFFC6 - 0xFFD3 are mapped to the VDG Address Offset, which indicates the starting address in RAM for video output to be mapped:

 - Set any data on 0xFFC6 = clear bit 0
 - Set any data on 0xFFC7 = set bit 0
 - Set any data on 0xFFC8 = clear bit 1
 - Set any data on 0xFFC9 = set bit 1
 - Set any data on 0xFFCA = clear bit 2
 - Set any data on 0xFFCB = set bit 2
 - Set any data on 0xFFCC = clear bit 3
 - Set any data on 0xFFCD = set bit 3
 - Set any data on 0xFFCE = clear bit 4
 - Set any data on 0xFFCF = set bit 4
 - Set any data on 0xFFD0 = clear bit 5
 - Set any data on 0xFFD1 = set bit 5
 - Set any data on 0xFFD2 = clear bit 6
 - Set any data on 0xFFD3 = set bit 6

In this case, to set the seven bits of the VDG display offset to 3 (`000 00111`) we end up writing (any data at all) to these addresses:
`
 0xFFC7 (set bit 0 to 1 i.e. xxx xxx1)
 0xFFC9 (set bit 1 to 1 i.e. xxx xx1x)
 0xFFCA (set bit 2 to 0 i.e. xxx x0xx)
 0xFFCC (set bit 3 to 0 i.e. xxx 0xxx)
 0xFFCE (set bit 4 to 0 i.e. xx0 xxxx)
 0xFFD0 (set bit 5 to 0 i.e. x0x xxxx)
 0xFFD2 (set bit 6 to 0 i.e. 0xx xxxx)
`

What does the offset of "3" actually mean in the RAM? As the offsets are measured in 512 byte chunks,  this means that the data begins at 3 x 512 = 1536, or 0x0600. Therefore the data beginning from 0x600 corresponds directly to the output at the upper-left corner of the screen.

As it happens this makes sense, as 0x0600 is precisely where system-reserved RAM ends and the graphics page areas begin.

## VDG Modes in SAM
We then use the same technique on a different address:
```
17BB: 8E FF C0     LDX #$FFC0  Address for SAM VDG mode
17BE: 86 06        LDA #$06    Set A to 6 (binary 110)
17C0: C6 03        LDB #$03    Set B to 3
17C2: 8D 09        BSR $17CD   Set SAM, 3 bits with mask 110
```

The bits 110 correspond to video mode "CG6", which is definitely the best for games at 128 x 192 with 4 colors.

## VDG Modes via I/O mappings
```
17C4: B6 FF 22     LDA $FF22  Address for SAM input/output interfaces
17C7: 8A E0        ORA #$E0   New SAM, 8 bits with mask 1110 0000
17C9: B7 FF 22     STA $FF22  
17CC: 39           RTS
```

We may notice in the previous section that setting 3 bits on the SAM is not actually enough to specify the exact mode that we want; the inputs to the VDG also need to be configured.

![SAM and MC6847 inputs for various video modes](../images/SAM_and_MC6847_Video_Modes.png)

Indeed the mask that we set on V0, V1 and V2, `110`, could specify CG6 (COLOR GRAPHICS SIX) or RG6 (RESOLUTION GRAPHICS SIX). The only thing separating the two is the bit for `GM0`, which is configured not on the SAM but on the VDG.

How do we configure the flags on the VDG? It seems that we still do this *via* the SAM, in this case via the SAM I/O memory mappings in the range FF00 to FF5F:

![SAM I/O mappings, FF00 to FF5F](../images/MC6883_IO_FF00_to_FF5F.png)

The code specifically sets the byte at `FF22`. According to the detailed memory map for this address:

![Memory map for FF22](../images/CoCo_Memory_Map_FF22.png)

a mask of `1110 0000` would set:

 - VDG control output GM1 = 1
 - VDG control output GM2 = 1
 - VDG control output NOT(A)/G = 1

This ensures that the graphics mode is set to 128 x 192, 4-color mode.

Note that when running in MESS, during load the mask is already set to `0000 0100`, which indicates 16K of memory vs 4K. We load and then OR the byte from `FF22` so that we don't lose existing flags like this.

## Fun with video modes
Now that we know how the video mode is set, we can mess up the game in all sorts of interesting ways just by changing a single byte.

If we change 0x17C8 from E0 to F0 we switch from COLOR GRAPHICS SIX to RESOLUTION GRAPHICS SIX:

![Video fun with RG6](../images/Video_Fun_RG6.png)

If we change 0x17C8 from E0 to C0, and 0x17BF from 06 to 04, we get COLOR GRAPHICS THREE:

![Video fun with CG3](../images/Video_Fun_CG3.png)

Finally, if we change 0x17C8 from E0 to 00, we get SEMIGRAPHICS TWELVE:

![Video fun with SG12](../images/Video_Fun_SG12.png)

I'm impressed that the game still runs, and you can almost make out the title.

title: Initialize video ($0013â€”0016)
---

```
0013: BD D7 B2     JSR $D7B2
```

This subroutine is shown in pieces below.

```
17B2: 8E FF C6     LDX #$FFC6   Address for SAM VDG display offset
17B5: 86 03        LDA #$03     
17B7: C6 07        LDB #$07     
17B9: 8D 12        BSR $17CD    Set SAM, 7 bits with mask 000 0011
```

We then do a very similar thing to a different address:
```
17BB: 8E FF C0     LDX #$FFC0  Address for SAM VDG mode
17BE: 86 06        LDA #$06
17C0: C6 03        LDB #$03
17C2: 8D 09        BSR $17CD   Set SAM, 3 bits with mask 110
```

The bits 110 correspond to video mode "CG6", which is definitely the best for games at 128 x 192 with 4 colors.

```
17C4: B6 FF 22     LDA $FF22  Address for SAM input/output interfaces
17C7: 8A E0        ORA #$E0   New SAM, 8 bits with mask 1110 0000
17C9: B7 FF 22     STA $FF22  
17CC: 39           RTS
```

So we're setting some values that are mapped to 

According to the memory map for FF22:

![Memory map for FF22](images/CoCo_Memory_Map_FF22.png)

this mask will set:

 - VDG control output GM1 = 1
 - VDG control output GM2 = 1
 - VDG control output NOT(A)/G = 1

This also set the graphics mode (on the VDG this time rather than the SAM) to 128 x 192, 4-color mode.

Note that when running in MESS, during load the mask is already set to `0000 0100`, which indicates 16K of memory vs 4K. We load and then OR the existing value so that we don't lose the previous masks.

The subroutine at $17CD, I'll call `write_to_SAM_register`:

```
17CD: 46           RORA        
17CE: 24 06        BCC $17D6   Branch if carry-bit 0
17D0: 30 01        LEAX +$01,X 
17D2: A7 80        STA ,X+     
17D4: 20 02        BRA $17D8
17D6: A7 81        STA ,X++ 
17D8: 5A           DECB
17D9: 26 F2        BNE $17CD  Next B (i.e. return to top)
17DB: 39           RTS
```

As I discovered later, this piece of code is the idiomatic way to set these bits on the SAM, and is actually listed almost exactly as above on page 16 of the MC6883 technical specs.

The addresses 0xFFC6 - 0xFFD3 are mapped to the VDG Address Offset, which indicates the starting address in RAM for video output to be mapped:

 - Set any data on 0xFFC6 = clear bit 0
 - Set any data on 0xFFC7 = set bit 0
 - Set any data on 0xFFC8 = clear bit 1
 - Set any data on 0xFFC9 = set bit 1
 - Set any data on 0xFFCA = clear bit 2
 - Set any data on 0xFFCB = set bit 2
 - Set any data on 0xFFCC = clear bit 3
 - Set any data on 0xFFCD = set bit 3
 - Set any data on 0xFFCE = clear bit 4
 - Set any data on 0xFFCF = set bit 4
 - Set any data on 0xFFD0 = clear bit 5
 - Set any data on 0xFFD1 = set bit 5
 - Set any data on 0xFFD2 = clear bit 6
 - Set any data on 0xFFD3 = set bit 6

The subroutines in this case write to:
```
 0xFFC7 (xxxxxx1)
 0xFFC9 (xxxxx1x)
 0xFFCA (xxxx0xx)
 0xFFCC (xxx0xxx)
 0xFFCE (xx0xxxx)
 0xFFD0 (x0xxxxx)
 0xFFD2 (0xxxxxx)
```

In this case it's set to 3 (`000 0011`). As the offsets are measured in 512 byte chunks,  this means that the data begins at 3 x 512 = 1536, or 0x0600. Therefore the data beginning from 0x600 corresponds directly to the output at the upper-left corner of the screen.

As it happens this makes sense, as 0x0600 is precisely where system-reserved RAM ends and the graphics page areas begin.
